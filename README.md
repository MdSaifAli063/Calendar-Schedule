# 📅 Calendar & Schedule

A clean, responsive calendar with a day schedule panel. Navigate months, select dates, add and delete events — all with a polished white/blue UI and a subtle background. Data is saved locally (localStorage) and the API layer can be switched to a real backend later.

- Double-click index.html

Option B — Serve locally (recommended for consistent assets)

## 🧭 Usage

- ◀️ ▶️ Use the arrows to switch months.
- 🔘 Click any date cell to select it.
- ✍️ Add an event:
  - Pick a time
  - Enter a title
  - Click “Add Event”
- 🗑️ Delete an event using the trash icon.
- 📅 Click “Today” to jump to the current date.
- 🧽 “Clear All Events” removes all saved events (localStorage key: events_v1).

---

## 🛠️ Configuration & Customization

- Background image:
  - In style.css, set the CSS variable --hero-image to your image:
    - Example: --hero-image: url('/assets/hero.jpg');
    - Or set to none to rely on gradients only.
- Colors:
  - Edit palette in :root within style.css (blue shades + green highlight).
- Today highlight (green):
  - Controlled by .day.is-today rules in style.css.
- Weekend styling:
  - Subtle highlight via nth-child selectors in the calendar grid.

## 🔌 API Mode (Optional)

By default, events are stored in localStorage through an async wrapper. To use a real API:

1. Open script.js
2. Set API_BASE_URL to your backend base URL (e.g., https://your-api.example.com)
3. Implement endpoints:
   - GET /events?date=YYYY-MM-DD → returns [{ id, date, time, title }]
   - POST /events → body { date, time, title } → returns created event
   - DELETE /events/:id → returns 200/204

The UI will work the same; only storage changes.

## 🧪 Tips & Troubleshooting

- Dates overlapping?
  - Ensure the calendar grid rules exist in style.css:
    - .calendar__days { grid-template-columns: repeat(7, minmax(0, 1fr)); grid-auto-rows: minmax(90px, auto); }
- Material icons not showing?
  - Check this line in index.html head:
    - <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
- Time input odd on iOS/Safari?
  - That’s the native time control; it’s expected. You can swap to a custom time picker if needed.
